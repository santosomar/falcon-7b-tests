# Omar's Falcon 7B Tests
Falcon-7B-Instruct is a 7B parameters causal decoder-only model built by TII based on Falcon-7B and finetuned on a mixture of chat/instruct datasets. It is made available under the Apache 2.0 license.

Falcon, a cutting-edge series of language models developed by the Technology Innovation Institute in Abu Dhabi, has been introduced under the Apache 2.0 license. Notably, Falcon-40B stands out as the inaugural model that possesses capabilities comparable to several existing closed-source models, marking a significant advancement. This development is highly promising for practitioners, enthusiasts, and industries, as it unlocks numerous exciting possibilities.

This is a playground repository where I will explore their distinctive qualities, followed by demonstrating how effortlessly they can be utilized as a foundation (including inference, quantization, finetuning, and more) using tools from the Hugging Face ecosystem.
